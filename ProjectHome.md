An auto gladder for GFW. No ssh tunnel, no socks proxy configure, no VPN connection needed:

> - Start point: It runs on your home router(for example, DDWRT/OpenDRT, or a dedicated low power consumption server like ATOM).

> - End point: It requires no root privilege, a VPS host which can run python will do the job. Or even a socks5 proxy. (not suggested though, which the communication in proxy is not encrypted and can be intercepted by GFW)
